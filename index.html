            My name is Matthew Lesniewicz. I am 23 years old and am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp. I live in
            Midlothian VA and am a recent graduate of VCU. I majored in computer science with a minor in math. In my
            free time I enjoy practicing my coding skills, watching movies, playing video games, and going out to eat
            with friends.
        </p>

            In college, I mainly focused on java programming, math, and database development. I really enjoyed learning
            these topics but I always had an interest in web development. My schooling at VCU did
            not include much web development but I studied and practiced some in my free time and decided that I wanted
            a career in this field. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp after college to become a full stack web
            developer.
